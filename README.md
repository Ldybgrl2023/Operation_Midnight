# Operation_Midnight
Here you'll find some simple sql projects I have done while completing the Khan Academy SQL course. I'm currently trying to land my first role in Data Analytics and am trying to build up my portfolios. All comments and suggestions are welcome. Please remember to be kind as I am new to this whole genre and am still learning as I go.
